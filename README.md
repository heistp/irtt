# IRTT (Isochronous Round-Trip Time)

IRTT tests round-trip time, one-way delay and IPDV (jitter) using UDP packets
sent on a fixed period, and optionally writes results to JSON. It was initially
envisioned as a tool for [Flent](https://flent.org), but may be useful for
other purposes as well. It is written in Go.
